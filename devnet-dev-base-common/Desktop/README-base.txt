Welcome to the Cisco DevNet Developer Base machine!

This Developer machine has been created as a tool to help developers understand and use the Cisco Platform developer technology. We have done our best to create something that will be useful and relevant, and we would appreciate your feedback on our efforts. 

Any questions, thoughts, thanks, congratulations, and so on, should be sent to devnet-developer-tools@cisco.com, or use the support community here: 

https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/dev-vm. 

You don´t ask, you don´t get :-)

This, base version, of the VM is used as a means to provide a common toolset for further VMs that include platform specific technology covering, for example, the Cisco Open SDN Controller. APIC-EM, ACI, NX-API, Netcong/Yang APIs and so on. See the community at the link above for further details.
